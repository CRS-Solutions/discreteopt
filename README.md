## Discrete Optimization assignments
--------------------

The code in this repository is about the _Discrete optimization_ class given by the University of Melbourne, via the Coursera platform. The project and the source code is public but if, by any chance, you land on this page you should bear in mind that:

  - According to the Coursera honor code, and to the class requirements, you should not use any of the given code, although you may take inspiration from it.
  - The code is definitely in a poor state, both performance- and quality-wise. I have taken the class with the intention to revisit some techniques I already knew and put a minimal effort in the assignment, in order to use what I learnt for other projects (much better implemented, whose repositories are not public though!). Thus, even if this code would allow you to pass the course with a good grade, you should really avoid to use it.
  - Have fun!
